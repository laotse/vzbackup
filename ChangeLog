2009-08-10 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Fixed locale to C and removed German pattern


2009-08-09 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Corrected some typos

	* read_glogal_vz_conf() -> read_global_vz_conf()
	* copy&paste error in restore_openvz()

2009-08-09 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Added restore for --no-archive and --sane

	* moved archive type detection into firstfile()
	  produce the equivalent file from flat copies
	* moved the 'tar xpf' core into restore_files()
	  use it in both restore_qemu() and restore_openvz()
	  add rsync method to support flat copies
	* moved $tmpdir creation before --restore processing
	  pass $tmpdir to restore_openvz() - eventually required for state.bin
	* if /etc/vzdump holds state.bin.gz
	  move it to $tmpdir
	  rmtree /etc/vzdump; mkpath /etc/vzdump to get rid of everything else
	  unpack it to /etc/vzdump
	  display instructions to resume the machine
	* updated documentation of --restore

2009-08-09 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Added --lvm option

	It is useful to have LVM2 snapshots at hand, even if we decide to stop 
	the machine in order to have a clean filesystem.
	--lvm makes this feature independent from the stopmode; actual code 
	change is a single line in backup_vm()

	Furthermore, some reordering in the help texts in print_usage()

2009-08-09 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Patch to mitigate rmtree risks

	Since vzdump runs as root some regex gone awry could yield a 
	parameter to rmtree, which can wreck your system

	* safe_mkpath fills @safe_paths with the paths actually created by 
	  vzdump
	* safe_rmtree removes only trees, which are subtrees of @safe_paths
	  if existing directories, which are not on @safe_paths shall be 
	  removed, a warning is logged
	* at the end of execution @safe_paths holds paths created, but not 
	  removed 
	  these exist, for sure, but could also help in consistence checks

	NOTE:
	The safe_ versions currently take only one path instead of a list and 
	do not process options. Since there are

2009-08-09 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Added a single log message to make me relax watching the tests


2009-08-08 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Fixed bugs appearing in the LVM process flow


2009-08-08 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Fixed regex to work in German locale, also


2009-08-08 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Completely restructured backup core

	This commit is tested in the sandbox, ie. LVM stuff is untested.
	* Added "use warnings;" for bug hunting
	* put cstream under check_bin() control
	* Moved all session variables into $bckpar hash, which is passed by 
	  reference to all subs
	  subs will add their information to this hash, too
	  $bckpar is valid for only one VEID and shall be recreated afterwards
	  The goal is that all variables except $bckpar and $opt_* are local 
	  to each sub

	* dissolved snapshot_vm() and archive_vm() into smaller pieces; these 
	  main functions are gone
	* established a central flow-control into vm_backup() using 8 disjoint 
	  phases

	* vm_status() gets the {status} string and sets the {running} flag 
	  (from snapshot_vm())
	* determine_lvm() sets {snapdev}, if LVM snapshot is possible or 
	  reduces {stopmode} to 'suspend', otherwise
	  This may change, since I intend to offer LVM snapshotting independent
	  from the stopmode - but that's for later times
	  All lvm related parameters are only available, if determine_lvm() 
	  returned true
	* lvmsnapshot() creates the snapshot device, but does not mount it
	* mount_snapshot() mounts the latter and returns the directory, where 
	  it is finally hung
	* create_archive() creates a tar archive according to the cli options 
	  from $src -> $archive
	* rsync_vm() performs all the rsync tasks (first snapshot, final copy, 
	  archiving from snapdev to directory)
	* freeze_vm() stops or suspends the machine according to stopmode
	* resume_vm() resumes following a freeze_vm()
	* dump_checkpoint() writes the VE state to a file. I don't know, if a 
	  similar operation is available for qemu deployments
	* flush_ctrl() {ctrldir} is a temporary directory used if no other 
	  directory is available at the time;
	  flush_ctrl() copies these files to their final destination and 
	  removes this directory
	  Currently this only applies the VE state file in case of a LVM 
	  snapshot; its destination directory just does not exist or will 
	  be overwritten whenthe fiel is produced
	* copy_conf() copy the configuration files of the node into 
	  $dest = /etc/vzdump of the image

	TODO:
	* Testing!
	* Restore

2009-08-06 Dr. Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	Added .gitignore

2009-07-28  Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	* vzdump: added option --one-filesystem to support
	snapshots of VE, which mount large external file systems
	and eventually share those.
	Corrected some typos.
	Note that all of the recent changes are weakly tested inside
	a kvm sandbox with a single non LVM filesystem.
	
2009-07-27  Lars Hanke <lars@lhanke.de>

	* vzdump: added options --sane and --no-archive. 
	--sane enforces at least a --suspend of the VM even if --snapshot 
	has been selected. The internal state of the suspended machine is 
	save to /etc/vzdump of the dump. No changes in --stop mode, since 
	this is always sane. If --compress is selected, the VM state is 
	compressed.
	--no-archive puts the resulting dump into a directory of plain files
	into --dumpdir/$VEID instead of creating a tar archive.
	
2009-05-29  Proxmox Support Team  <support@proxmox.com>

	* vzdump (get_lvm_device): also return filesystem type
	(snapshot_vm): always mount with '-t $fstype', pass "-o nouuid"
	for xfs filesystems.

	* vzdump: add --wait option, using locbal lock file to
	make sure only one instance is running
	
	* vzdump: set default snapshot size to 1GB, new --size option to
	specify snapshot size

	* copyright: fixed fsf address

	* Makefile (SBINDIR): set to /usr/sbin (command is only useful for 
	user root)

	* vzdump.spec, control.in: we now depend on rsync, cstream and MTA

2007-05-21  Proxmox Support Team  <support@proxmox.com>

	* vzdump: new --exclude-path option, use 'find' to avoid tar
	sockets warnings, try to skip all log files by default, use tar
	option --ignore-failed-read

2007-05-10  Proxmox Support Team  <support@proxmox.com>

	* vzdump: additionally log time, new --exclude option (suggested
	by Ugo Bellavance)

2007-04-04  Proxmox Support Team  <support@proxmox.com>

	Jernej Proenta)

2007-03-26  Proxmox Support Team  <support@proxmox.com>

	/vz/private/$VEID/etc/vpsdump after backup (bug reported by
	Thorsten Schifferdecker)
	(check_bin): find correct path (bug reported by
	Thorsten Schifferdecker)
